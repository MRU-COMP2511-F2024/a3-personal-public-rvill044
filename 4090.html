        <p>Nvidia's 4090 is the best GPU on the market to date. Released in October 12, 2022, not only is it the fastest
            GPU, it also contains AV1 support, dual NVEC, and frame generation also known as DLSS. The 4090 is
            <i>the</i> GPU if you want the best
            performance period. Both in 4k gaming as well as content creation, everything about the 4090 makes it the
            king as of right now. However, the only downside of the 4090 is its price: retailing at $1599 USD.

                <p>Thanks to tom's Hardware for the graph. Click the image to go to tom's Hardware website for the full
                    review. Do note, we are using the performance metrics from the 7900 XTX review because it contains
                    both the 4090 AND the 7900 XTX.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 4k gaming, no doubt the 4090 wins by a signficant margin. Outclassing AMD's flasgship GPU the
                    7900 XTX. Even in native rasterization, the 4090 can comfortably run 60 FPS in any game. The FPS
                    being dramatically inreased when frame generation is activated, also known as DLSS.

                <h2>Nvidia 4090 Performance in 1440p</h2>
                <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review">
                    <img class="gpuImg" src="images/1440pperform.png" alt="1440pperformance">
                </a>
                <p>The 4090's dominance starts to lower as the resolution lowers down to 1440p. This is because the
                    lower the resolution you go, the more CPU dependant your system becomes.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    Regardless, the 4090 still tops the performance chart with its 1% lows similar to the 7900 XTX.

                <h2>Nvidia 4090 Performance in 1080p</h2>
                <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review">
                    <img class="gpuImg" src="images/1080perform.png" alt="1080pperformance">
                </a>
                <p>In 1080p things start to become more interesting. As the resolution is set to 1080p, the system
                    becomes CPU bottlenecked. Therfore in order to obtain the best performance, you need to have a
                    strong CPU to support the 4090.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    As a result, we can see the 4090's performance lead dimish to the point where the 7900 XTX is
                    slightly behind the 4090 in terms of performance.

                <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    My personal thoughts about the 4090 is its strictly a 4k card and nothing more. Getting the 4090 for
                    1440p or 1080p gaming is a waste of money, especially of the pricey price tag.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    However, the 4090's performance at 4k is undeniable. It is the crown of GPU's currently on the
                    market and will only be dethroned by the 50 series cards that is set to release next year.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    If the 4090 boasts this level of performance at 4k rasterization, even more with frame generation
                    (DLSS). Who knows how much the 5090 can improve on this cards already impressive performance.
