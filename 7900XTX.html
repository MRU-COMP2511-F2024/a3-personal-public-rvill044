        <p> AMD's flagship graphics card that released in December 13, 2022. Signficantly cheaper compared to Nvidia's
            4090 card and has better performance in rasterization versus Nvidia's 4080 Super. Bolstering 24 gigabytes of
            video memory, and superior performance at the fraction of the cost of the 4090. The 7900 XTX is a strong buy
            for those who purely want rasterized gaming.

                    The 7900 XTX is heavily outclassed by Nvidia's 4090, however it beats the 4080 by around 4% on
                    average. However although the 7900 XTX is outclassed by the 4090, it is 60% cheaper.

                <p> Same performance compared in 1440p compared to 4k, the 4090 outclasses every GPU on the market.
                    However, the 7900 XTX still beats the 4080 in pure rasterization.

                </a>
                <p> Yet again, same metrics compared to 4k and 1440p. However, the dominant gap of the 4090 is lessened
                    in 1080p due to the resolution becoming more CPU dependant rather than the GPU.

                <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
                <p> All in all, the 7900 XTX is a very competitve card versus Nvidia's line of top end GPU's. Although
                    being outclassed by the 4090, the 7900 XTX is signifcantly cheaper, and outclasses and of Nvidia's
                    4080 Super and below GPU's.
                    <br><br>
                    That is, if you're looking for pure rasterized gameplay, AND don't care about ray tracing, AMD and
                    the 7900 XTX is the way to go.
