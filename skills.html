            This webpage will be going over various skills that make me who I am today. Ranging from my technical to
            soft skills, things that I have honed throughout the years both in an academic setting, and outside.

                <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    The techincal langauges that I know are: C++, Java, and Python.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    I learned C++ when I was initally at the University of Lethbridge, I stayed there for one and a half
                    years. Learning the basics of C++, building and testing projects in GitHub. I personally think that
                    since I started with C++ as my first langauge, Java came easy to me. However, I'm reviewing C++ in
                    my free time to become reacquainted with the language in order to expand my knowledge.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The second language that I know is Java, only learning the lanauge this Fall 2024 semester. I
                    personally found it came quickly to me, as I was already familiar with the syntax from C++. The only
                    things that I needed to acquaint myself is the documentation of functions and how Java itself
                    worked.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The third language that I am learning in my free time is Python. Since I transfered, I didn't have
                    to take Programming I here unlike my peers, which, they learned Python. Additionally, after talking
                    to a few of my friends who are already working in the field, mention how invaluable Python is as a
                    language to know. So, to make myself more appealing to future employers, I'm learning to get Python
                    under my belt.

                <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
                <p>The soft skills that I have is my attention to detail, commucation, and multitasking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My attention to detail stems from my time debugging code and diagnosing errors that come up while
                    programming. Additionally, I worked as Boston Pizza as a Line Chef back in 2018, which I needed to
                    fire multiple dishes at the same time in order to get the order out on time, and all at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I personally think that my communication skills is one of my strong points. Consistently achiving
                    good scores on writing assignments, as well as public speaking. Furthermore, communication in a
                    team, as both working in the workplace as well as groups in school, further enhanced my abilities to
                    communicate clearly and effectively. As a result, for those reasons, I
                    personally believe that communucation is one of my strong suits.

                <p>
                    Lastly is my multitasking. Going back to my attention to detail, of being able to simultaneously
                    cook multiple dishes at the same time. Additionally, I was in the Calgary Stampede Showband, where I
                    had to march in time while performing music as no easy feat.
