        <p>
            This page highlights the projects I worked out throughout the semester. This website, is the accumulation of
            everything I have learned in COMP 2511, Web Development.

                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>
                    The technical decisions I made is for ease of readability and utility. For example, wrapping
                    everything into divs in order for my code to be readable when I come back to work on it. For
                    example, this webpage is based off of my assignment 2, as it fulfills the form factor that I need.

                <p>
                    Some of the challenges I faced while designing the website is the responsiveness and using grids.
                    However, it only required time and a little bit of tweaking to obtain the desired layout.

                <h2>Design</h2>

                <p>The design of the website is intentional, personally, I don't like flashy and strong colours that pop
                    out. I prefer the muted and subtle colours that are easy on the eyes. Additionally, it applies from
                    the Gestalt principles in order to make the website appealing to viewers.

                    <figcaption>The color palette I used for this website.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The image above is the colour palette I used for this website. I had to tinker with the palette as I
                    wanted colours that are subtle and are easy on the eyes.

                <h2>Challenges</h2>

                <p>Like I mentioned earlier in the technical section, some of the challenges I've experienced is
                    formatting the grid template for the website. As I had to play around with grid columns to place
                    each section where they belong depending on the size of the screen.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <a href="images/CSScodeexample.png">
                        <img class="gpuImg" src="images/CSScodeexample.png" alt="CSScodeexample">
                    </a>
                    <figcaption>The CSS code snippet of the websites grid layout.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Once I formatted the website to the layout I desired, everything else quickly fell into place.
                    Another small hurdle I experienced was coding the responsiveness of the website, coding the mobile
                    hamburger menu when to show up on the appropriate screens. However, as I read and worked through the
                    problem, it eventually fell into place as well
                </p>

                <h2>What Could Be Improved</h2>

                <p> What I personally think what could be improved on my website is the ultization of Javascript.
                    Although I didn't have the time throughout the semester to commit to self-studying, I see the value
                    in overall usefulness with the ulization of Javascript.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    For example, creating code that when clicking the images in this website, it doesn't open into a new
                    page. But rather, pops up on the screen to its full image, while staying on the webpage.
