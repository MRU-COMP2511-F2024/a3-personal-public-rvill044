            This page highlights the projects I worked out throughout the semester. This website, is the accumulation of

            This website (COMP 2511 Assignment 3) is part of the ePortfolio, which will be the focus as I discuss and
            illustrate the technical and

                    Technical
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Most of the technical heavy lifting is done from assignment 2 as most elements has been lifted from
                    the previous assignment. Personally, I was happy with out assignment 2 turned out so I didn't see
                    the need of redesigning the website or writing code that drastically changes the website shape and
                    feel.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Design
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Likewise from the technical aspect, I didn't see the need to completely redesign the website's
                    design in colour palette and form. Only because I'm personally happy with how it looks, especially
                    the colour palette.

                <p>
                    The only thing I really needed to add and change is adding a nav bar that showcases all 6 tabs, as
                    well as editing the Home and Contact Me Pages. Furthermore, I made sure to let the user know what
                    page they're on in the task bar, for ease of readability and use.

                    Challenges
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In the form of challenges I've encounted in this assignment, there was only one incident. Legacy
                    code coming from assignment 2 cause massive white space between content and the footer. Only after
                    tinkering with it, I found the problem: a grid-template-row CSS rule was causing it and so I got rid
                    of it.

                    What Could be Improved
                </h3>
                <p> What I personally think what could be improved on my website is the ultization of Javascript.
                    Although I didn't have the time throughout the semester to commit to self-studying, I see the value
                    in overall usefulness with the ulization of Javascript.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, creating code that when clicking the images in this website, it doesn't open into a new
                    page. But rather, pops up on the screen to its full image, while staying on the webpage.

                    The technical decisions I made is for ease of readability and utility. For example, wrapping
                    everything into divs in order for my code to be readable when I come back to work on it.

                    Some of the challenges I faced while designing the website is the responsiveness and using grids.
                    However, it only required time and a little bit of tweaking to obtain the desired layout.

                    What Could be Improved
                </h3>
                <p>
                    What could be improved from assignment 2 is adding a more easy to navigate task bar. Although almost
                    if not all websites use their logo as a home directory, adding a task bar with "Home" is more easily
                    acessible. Furthermore, avoiding any unnecessary frustrations of trying to find the home tab.

                    The technical objective was uplifting me and my team's code from assignment 2 and creating a GUI as
                    the interface for the assignment instead of using the terminal. After splitting up the work and
                    delegating, I was tasked with doing the third tab of the assignment, which was removing a toy
                    through the serial number.

                    scenes, everything else came naturally into place for me at least.

                <p>
                    (Refer to the code snapshot) The biggest issue that stumped me for a good bit was whenever I ran the
                    remove serial number, any subsequent requests yeilded a blank arraylist. As I coded it to search
                    through the arraylist object then remove that object with the matching specifications, in this case,
                    the serial number. <br><br>
                    However, when it removed it and ran the updateListView(), it completely wiped the object arraylist,
                    turning it into an empty one instead. When I was coding it, I was testing with true/false
                    iterations, as I was soley convinced that the issue was in the removeSerialNumberTab3() function.
                    And not the real issue, of it being in updateListView(). <br><br>
                    When I took a break and came back, I decided to look over the code as a whole and see the logical
                    process. That's when I found the bug in the updateListView() where it wipes the object arraylist.
                    And so, that's how I solved the biggest hurdle for me in COMP 1502 assignment 3.

                    herrings and getting frustrated over a working function, when the real bug is in another one
                    instead.

                    The technical requirements of assignment 2 was reading a text file with toy specifications, putting
                    them into 4 unique objects, then adding them all into one object arraylist to be purchased or
                    removed. As the assignment specifictions said that we were writing code for a toy store. <br><br>
                    My role in this assignment was the loading content from the text file and saving from the object
                    arraylist back into a textfile.

                    I loaded the text file, then I delimited it by using the split function, then I called the function
                    ToyConstructor() to organize the toys from the textfile into an object arraylist. I created another
                    function call to avoid bloating the current function, and to make it easier to read whenever an
                    error occurs.

                    The biggest challenge on my part of assignment 2 was saving to a text file. Intially, I thought I
                    could simply pull specifc variables from the object array then load them into the text file. It
                    didn't work which caused me some frustration, however, what I failed to realize is that in an object
                    array, it only contains objects, therefore me trying to pull specific variables wouldn't work.

                    What I realized is that I completely overcomplicated my code and instead of trying to rewrite the
                    textfile based on specific variables, I can simply print out the object array back into the
                    arraylist.

                    What Could be Improved
                </h3>
                <p>
                    What could be improved is me further understanding how objects interact in arrays, object arrays,
                    and so one. Furthermore, taking the time to understand and design functions before jumping in and
                    code without thinking.
