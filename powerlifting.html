                    The reason why I started going to the gym is a petty reason actually. When I was visting some
                    relatives in Georgia, one of my relatives, nothing more than 12-13 years old, mentioned somthing
                    about how much food me and my brother was eating. To my aunt's hushing and saying to speak in
                    Tagalog because me and my brother won't understand, which is a lie. <br> <br>
                    However, for some reason, I took offense to that and I swore to myself that whenver I visit my
                    relatives again, I would be the biggest I could ever be.

                    I offically started the gym journey on Janurary 6th, 2023. I was fortunate enough to have a friend
                    help me go to the gym for the first few months, which initally, my motivation was strong and it was
                    only amplified by my friend, Tyler. <br> <br>
                    Eventually, my petty reason for going to the gym disapeared and I found out that I actually enjoy
                    going to the gym. Which quickly became one of my favourite activies, which I look forward to
                    everday, eventually picking up powerlifting, a sport I fell in love with.

                    What I learned from the gym is that its a great catalyst for change. Ever since going to the gym,
                    I've noticed not only my physical and mental state improve, but also becoming more confident in
                    myself. <br> <br>
                    I developed long lasting friendships going to the gym and only strengthened my existing ones
                    already.

                    What I see myself doing in the future is competing in powerlifting. But before that, I personally
                    want to get my SBD numbers higher before I compete. Which is something I'm actively working towards.
