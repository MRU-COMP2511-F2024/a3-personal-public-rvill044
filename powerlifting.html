                <p>
                    The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is a powerhouse GPU, designed for gamers, creators, and professionals
                    who demand cutting-edge performance. Built on NVIDIA's Ada Lovelace architecture, it delivers
                    exceptional ray tracing, AI-driven features, and unprecedented speeds.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    With a massive 24GB of GDDR6X
                    memory and over 16,000 CUDA cores, the RTX 4090 excels in 4K gaming, real-time 3D rendering, and
                    complex AI workloads. Its advanced DLSS 3 technology enhances visual fidelity while maintaining
                    smooth frame rates, making it one of the most advanced graphics cards on the market.

                <h2>How Long?</h2>
                <p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, launching on January 31, 2024, brings enhanced performance to the
                    RTX 40 series lineup. With 10,240 CUDA cores, a 256-bit memory bus, and 16GB of ultra-fast GDDR6X
                    VRAM running at 23 Gbps, it delivers a memory bandwidth of 736.3 GB/s.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    This card offers a
                    significant boost in performance, being 1.4x faster than the RTX 3080 Ti in demanding games without
                    frame generation, and 2x faster with DLSS 3 enabled. It excels at 4K gaming with ray tracing and
                    supports advanced generative AI and productivity applications​.

                <h2>What I've Learned</h2>

                <p>The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX is a flagship GPU from AMD’s RDNA 3 lineup, aimed at high-end gaming and
                    productivity tasks. Featuring 24GB of GDDR6 memory and a 384-bit memory interface, it provides a
                    competitive alternative to NVIDIA’s higher-end RTX GPUs, particularly excelling in high-resolution
                    gaming up to 4K.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The RX 7900 XTX also boasts 96 compute units and advanced ray tracing capabilities,
                    making it well-suited for visually demanding games and creative applications. Its energy efficiency
                    and price point offer strong value, positioning it as a top choice for gamers who want powerful
                    performance without the premium of the highest-tier NVIDIA options.

                <h2>Future</h2>

                <p>The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT is a high-performance GPU built on AMD’s RDNA 3 architecture, offering a
                    strong balance of power and efficiency. With 20GB of GDDR6 memory and a 320-bit memory interface, it
                    handles 4K gaming well and supports ray tracing, making it a solid choice for gamers and creators
                    alike.
                </p><br>
                <p>
