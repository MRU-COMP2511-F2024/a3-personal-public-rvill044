            Gunpla, is the abbreviation of "Gundam Plastic Model" or to some, "plastic crack."
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            Gunpla is a hobby based off of the Gundam universe (or models released by Bandai, the company that produces
            Gunpla Models) where you could assemble models that comes pre-coloured.
            Allowing you to assemble the models right out of the box!

                <h2>Why?</h2>

                <p>
                    One of the reasons why I love Gunpla as a hobby is how theraputic it is. Taking the time to assemble
                    the model piece by piece and seeing the final result of everthing coming together is nothing short
                    of satisfying.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, I grew up watching Gundam as a kid, which only fueled my passion for the hobby even
                    more. Moreover, seeing how each model improves upon the last in the universe of Gundam. As I'm a
                    sucker for unique designations and variants of Mobile Suits (what they're called in lore).

                </figure>
                <p>I've been in the hobby for a year and a few months now actually. I decided to tap into my childhood
                    and buy a model on a whim, and when I finally assembled my first model, I became hooked.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    My first model took me around 3 hours to build, and my most recent model taking me (time counted)
                    around 9 or so hours on a complete build.

                <h2>What I've Learned</h2>

                    <figcaption>MS-07H-8 Gouf Flight Type.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>What I've learned in this hobby is to be patient and attention to detail. Following the instructions
                    to the letter to avoid messing up the model, as well as not rushing through it.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the biggest thing for me is learning to accept the things I like without fearing of
                    being judged. I was intially hesitant on freely telling people that I assemble models, however,
                    nowadays, I'm not afraid of showcasing my completed models to anyone who asks. Sometimes even
                    putting them on assignments for my teachers to see.

                </figure>
                <p>The future for Gunpla for me is continously collecting and assembling more kits. Furthrmore, each kit
                    improving on the last one build wise. As I want to dabble into painting or even adding custom parts
                    to my kits.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, theres a saying in the Gunpla community, "Gunpla is freedom". Which resonates with me
                    because no matter where everyone is skill wise, anyone can assemble the models in whatever way they
                    want. (More pictures are available at request.)
